About
=====

This repository has all of my code for the labs in my CS 240 class.  I have supplied this code to make completing the labs easier, to show examples of my work to potential employers, and to be a reference for others.  This code should not be used dishonestly, especially in a course with similar requirements.  If this code is found to be used dishonestly, I disavow any involvement.

Projects
========

Chess
-----

A graphical game of chess.  The UI was provided by the instructor, but I implemented all of the backend code.  The UI is not included in this repository, but any UI can be used with minor changes to the source.  Features include:

* Undo/redo
* Move validator
* Save to/load from file

Collections
-----------

Implementation of a LinkedList and a Binary Search Tree.  Both are free from memory leaks.

Sort
----

Proof of concept showing that I can use the qsort method.  This is implemented using double pointers to reduce overhead.

URLResolver
-----------

Resolves a URL given a base URL and a relative URL.

Webcrawler
----------

Indexes a website given a start URL.  For simplicity, only pages in the current domain are indexed.  This project is still in progress.  The README on that page has more information on the implementation design.
